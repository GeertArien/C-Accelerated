# C-Accelerated

Solutions to the end-of-chapter exercise files found in the C++ study book **Accelerated C++**, written by Andrew koeing and Barbara Moo (Published in 2000 by Addison-Wesley).

## Getting Started

This project was created using Visual Studio 2015 and compiled under the Microsoft Visual C++ compiler, version 14.0. In order to run these files under a different compiler it's likely that small changes need to be made to the source files.

For each chapter in the book a different project/folder has been created. Subsequently each exercise has it's own header and source file. At the top of the source file the exercise is outlined as described in the book.

This project is under active development.

## Contributing
